# Crowd mood anaysis at parties
In this thesis sensor data collected from parties is used to engineer a measure that quantifies
crowd mood. An infrared camera combined with supervised learning is used to determine
the crowd size. Air properties like temperature, humidity and the concentration of various
chemicals are used to determine the physical activity of the crowd and infer its general
mood based on that. Biases that affect the data like the ventilation system, fog machine
and cigarette smoke have to be addressed.
